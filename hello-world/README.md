# **Go Hello World Application Deployed with Docker**

This repository contains a simple "Hello World" application written in the Go programming language and deployed using Docker. The Go programming language, often referred to as Golang, is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and strong support for concurrency.

## **Application Overview**
The **"Hello World"** application in this repository is a basic example to demonstrate the use of Docker for deploying a Go application. It showcases how to containerize a Go program, making it easy to distribute and run on different platforms.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Docker:** Docker provides the necessary infrastructure to build and run containers. You can install Docker by following the official installation guide for your operating system.

## **Running the Application**

To run the "Hello World" application using Docker, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.

- Open a terminal and navigate to the project's directory.

- Build the Docker image by running the following command:

      docker build -t go-hello-world .

    This command will build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.

- Once the image is built successfully, you can run a container based on this image using the following command:

    docker run -p 8080:8080 go-hello-world

    This command will start a container from the Docker image and map port 8080 from the container to port 8080 on your local machine.

- Access the **"Hello World"** application by opening a web browser and navigating to **http://localhost:8080**. You should see a greeting message displayed.
